## cdrip

```

## cover.photo

### Usage

```
Music/Artist/2020 Album $> music-utils-cover-photo
```

Parse your current position (pwd) to extract artist and album information. Then, fetching matching cover photos from discogs.com and places the resulting image in a 'cover.jpg' file

## tag-album

```
Music/Artist/YYYY Album $> music-utils-tag-album
Music/Artist $> music-utils-tag-album -a YYYY Album
Music/Artist $> music-utils-tag-album --album YYYY Album
```

    | - A Band
| - B
    | - Band, A
```

where _A Band_ is actually the same band as _Band, A_ , similarities script will output as a table

### Usage

```
/>  ./scripts/similarities.sh -A /path/to/origin/ -B /path/to/comparator/ -T 0.5  -Q > output.table
```

Where

- **-A** is base directory
- **-B** is comparing directory
- **-T** is threshold of equality
- **-Q** to quiet
